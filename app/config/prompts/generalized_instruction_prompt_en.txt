{instr_detail}

1. Generate exactly {count_per_instr} queries.

   - **Natural Spoken Phrases**: Standard full sentences (e.g., "I want to turn on the light").
   - **Polite/Indirect**: (e.g., "Could you please...", "Would you mind...").

4. The intent must match the instruction exactly.
5. Output must be a strictly valid JSON list of objects.
